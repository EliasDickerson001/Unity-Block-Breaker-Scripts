# Unity-Block-Breaker-Scripts
C# game object scripts I wrote for a Block Breaker game I developed on the Unity platform.


These are a collections of scripts I wrote for a passion project while learning development on the Unity game platform.
Each script belongs to a game object and is responsible for controlling its behavior in game. 

Behavior includes:
- Keep game paddle in alignment with the current position of the mouse. 
- Small directional boost on ball collision to prevent boring play loops.
- Keeps track of brick health and destroy when health gone.
- Load level when all bricks are destroyed.
- Restart game when collider below gamespace detects ball collision. 
- Singleton pattern for in game music to prevent multiple instances of music player occurring.
